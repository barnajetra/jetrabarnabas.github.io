I am currently pursuing a PhD in Earth Sciences at the University of Memphis, expanding upon my Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University undergraduate background in Environmental Science and Resource Management. My research and academic interests are in the fields of groundwater, GIS, forest change, hydrology, and geomorphology. I'm really curious to know how human and natural activities influence ecosystems, water systems, and landscapes. In my research, I study the effects of forest changes on the environment and utilize GIS techniques to simulate and analyze surface water and groundwater dynamics. Combining these disciplines will allow me to support sustainable resource usage and better environmental management techniques.
